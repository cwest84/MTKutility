</div><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><i>MTKutility</i></b> is a rewrite as changes to Android made the original app unusable. The original app was
inspired by Bastiaan Naber's AndroidMTK app.&nbsp; The development
objective was to create an Android equivalent of the Windows app
MtkDlut (<a href="http://4river.a.la9.jp/gps/file/MtkDLut.htm" target="_blank">http://4river.a.la9.jp/gps/file/MtkDLut.htm</a>).&nbsp; <br>
<p class="MsoNormal">The
app's roots are in Keisuke Suzuki's AndroidUSBSerialMonitorLite and
FTdriver.&nbsp; It started as an AGPS data update to a USB connected
Qstarz
GPS logger.&nbsp; The development environment is Android Studio, a
Samsung SGHI717 with Android 4.1 and an ASUS_X00ID with Android
8.1.&nbsp; The finished app includes the GPX conversion fragment file
from Bastiaan Naber's AndroidMTK (Nov 2014 version).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Special thanks go to Tomas Garcia Haya for
becoming a co-developer on the rewrite.&nbsp; Also honorable mentions
to the following who helped with issues on the prior version.<br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Satoshi
Kinoshita for helping me resolve a HTC One crash issue</li>
  <li>Thomas
Herrmann for testing the GPS receiver with AGPS (no logging) scenario</li>
  <li>Christian Bauer for testing the GPS logger without APGS scenario</li>
  <li>Ziva Zoran for testing the html SETTINGS tab and a number of bug fixes</li>
  <li>David Neill for testing changes for a small screen&nbsp; phone (3.2 inch display with a QVGA 320 x 240 resolution)<br>
  </li>

</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks
also to all the coders who contribute Android expertise to Stack
Overflow and the numerous other internet resources I have relied on for
help. I could not have accomplished all the learning that went into
this without the extensive guidance others provided.<br>
