</span></span></big></big></p>

<p><u1:p></u1:p><o:p></o:p></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><big><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">This app will only work with a GPS device has the MTK GPS chipset.</span></big><br>
</div><br>
Thanks for choosing to use MTKutility.&nbsp; This version
represents a total rewrite of the app to overcome the barriers Android
updates created for the previous version.&nbsp; I need to extend a
speacial thank you to Tomas Garcia for all the help he provided with
this effort.&nbsp; As a result we are able to provide a product with a
wider range of proven performance on phone and gps logger devices.<br>
<br>
Please note that the
entire interface has changed.&nbsp; The details of how this new app
works are in the <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Help</span>
document.&nbsp; The menu is now
Android's Drawer layout - swipe from the left - or click the 3 bar block at the top left of the screen.&nbsp; Please review the <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Help</span>
document before continuing with MTKutility.&nbsp; Most of
the app functions have changed.<br>
<br>
Android continues to isolate apps so that they can't affect resources from other apps.&nbsp;
You no longer have a choice on when files are created.&nbsp; They will
be in what your phone defines as the download folder.&nbsp; You will
need to use your phone's folder/file app to relocate the files if space
is a problem.<br><br>
To use this app you need to pair your GPS logger in your phone&#8217;s
Bluetooth settings.&nbsp; Once you have your GPS device paired, you
need to assign it to this app on the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Home</span> screen. The app will fail if you attempt to connect without having a GPS logger assigned.<br>
<br>
The activities that appear in the menu are driven by your GPS logger capabilities. While the <span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Help</span> document shows all the activities, the menu you see after you connect will reflect your GPS device configuration.&nbsp; <br>
<br>

I created this app for personal use and I am not able to provide
dedicated time to dealing with issues.&nbsp; However, I will try to
resolve issues in my spare time.&nbsp; You can email <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><a href="mailto:adt.androidapps@gmail.com" target="_blank">adt.androidapps@gmail.com</a><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">or better still</span>, use the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Send App Log</span>
menu item and add your comments to the generated email.&nbsp; That way
I will also have a bit of information about your devices too.&nbsp; The
app has extensive
execution tracing built in and I may be able to resolve the problem.<br>
<br>
Still on the wish list:<br>
<ul><li>Expansion of the file browsers functionality.&nbsp; Right now it
is only capable of returning a file selection.&nbsp; I want to explore
if rename, delete, move to and copy to are also possible.</li>
  <li>The GPX file creation routine may not work correctly for Holux
downloads. Holux also deviated from the standard MTK command set so
there may be issues that I am unable to experience.</li>

  <li>Maybe a map interface for the GPX track.&nbsp; Will not be Google maps as Google has put a price on using the map API.</li>
  <li>SIRF 4 support - would need to find a way to get one for testing
- or partner with someone who is interested in learning Android coding.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

But these will be a while.&nbsp; Need a break - over 800 hours since Nov 2018 - eyes can take it any longer.<br>
